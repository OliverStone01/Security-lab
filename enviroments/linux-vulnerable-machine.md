# Linux vulnerable machine (Raspberry Pi)

This repository describes how I use my **Raspberry Pi** in a secure and ethical manner for **tool testing and skill development**. This environment is **not** used as daily drivers and **does not** contain any personal data or important long term data.

### The purpose of my Linux vulnerable machine:

My vulnerable machine is used as an attack surface that I can adjust and deploy depending on which tool or attack I want to practice. For example, I recreated a Brute Force attack by setting up my Raspberry Pi with Raspberry Pi OS (Linux) and activated SSH and auth logs. Once activated, I used my attack VM to Brute Force my way into the device and then analyzed the logs to see the difference between normal functioning logs and a Brute Force attack. You can see the whole attack and steps I took [here](https://github.com/OliverStone01/Security-lab/blob/main/learning/logs/linux-bruteforce-investigation.md).
