# Linux vulnerable machine (Raspberry Pi)

This repository describes how I use my **Raspberry Pi** in a secure and ethical manner for **tool testing and skill development**. This environment is **not** used as daily driver and **does not** contain any personal data or important long-term data.

### The purpose of my Linux vulnerable machine:

My vulnerable machine is used as an attack surface that I can adjust and deploy depending on which tool or attack I want to practice. For example, I recreated a Brute Force attack by setting up my Raspberry Pi running Raspberry Pi OS (Linux Debian) and activated SSH and auth logs. Once activated, I used my attack VM to Brute Force my way into the device and then analyzed the logs to see the difference between normal functioning logs and post Brute Force attack logs. You can see the whole attack and steps I took [here](https://github.com/OliverStone01/Security-lab/blob/main/learning/logs/linux-bruteforce-investigation.md).
