### IT support / helpdesk

IT support / helpdesk are the first point of contact for users when something goes wrong with their device or network. Their main focus is **availability and usability**.

Common problems they deal with:
- User's can't log in.
- Laptop is slow.
- Network conection dropped.
- Software won't install.
- Account locked out.

Common signs they work with:
- User reports.
- System error messages.
- Basic logs.
- Device status.
- Simple monitoring dashboards.

When a suspicious issue occurs, they don't investigate, they escalate.

### SOC analyst

SOC analysts monitor security alerts using SIEM tools (Security Information and Event Management), firewalls, and endpoint protection systems to detect suspicious activity. 

Common problems they deal with:
- Alerts.
- Potential attacks detected by tools.
- Suspicious log activity.
- Determining whether an incident is real or a false positive.

Common signs they work with:
- Alerts from SIEMs.
- Authentication logs.
- Firewall logs.
- Endpoint security alerts.
- IDS/IPS events.

SOC analysts do not fix systems, they investigate by following playbooks and work with predefined alerts. If an issue is found, they escalate.
