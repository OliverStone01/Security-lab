### Azure accounts
To use Azure, you first need to create an Azure account and choose a subscription.

A company might use a **single Azure account** for the business and **separate subscriptions** for development, marketing, and sales departments. Once you have created a Azure subscription, you can start creating Azure resources within each subscription.
