# Azure cost management

#### what can affect costs
Azure is an operational expense (OpEx) where you rent infrastructure as you need it.

OpEx costs can be impacted by:  
- **Resource type:** costs are influenced by type, settings, and region. Usage is tracked and billed based on metered instances.

- **Consumption**
- **Maintenance**
- **Geography**
- **Subscription type**
- **Azure marketplace:** Azure Marketplace offers Azure-based solutions and services from third-party vendors, including preconfigured servers and managed appliances. Billing structures are determined by the vendors.


#### Pricing calculator
The pricing calculator is used to help understand potential Azure expenses. You can access the calculator [here](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-gb/pricing/calculator/) and build out a configuration to see the cost.


#### cost management tools

#### Cost alerts
There are three types of alerts:
- Budget alerts
