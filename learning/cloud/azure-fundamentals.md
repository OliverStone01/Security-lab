# Microsoft Azure

Microsoft Azure is a cloud computing platform offering a wide range of services, from simple web hosting to complex virtualised computers and AI/IoT capabilities.

### What is cloud computing?
Cloud computing is the delivery of computing services over the internet. Computing services include virtual machines, storage, databases, and networking. Cloud services have now also begun to include Internet of Things (IoT), machines learning (ML), and artificial intelligence (AI).

Using cloud computing means you do not need to physically buy a computer with specific specs to host your systems. Instead, you choose how much power and the features you need and the cloud provider will allocate you these resources in their datacenter.

This allows you to only pay for what you use and if you need more power or storage, you can increase these resources instantly.

You also do not need to manage the upkeep of any physical devices, this is all covered by the cloud provider.

### Shared responsibility model
A shared responsibility model outlines who is responsible for what between the cloud provider and the consumer.

Providers responsibilities:
- Physical security.
- Power
- Cooling
- Network connectivity.


Consumers responsibilities:
- Data and information stored in the cloud.
- Access security.


Shared responsibilities (Situational responsibilities):
If you were to host a virtual device on the cloud, the cloud provider would be responsible for updating the host device, but the user/organisation is responsible for updating the virtual device.

The shared responsibility model is heavily tied to the cloud service type.
