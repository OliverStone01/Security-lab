# Log Basics (Level 0)

**What are logs?**  
Logs are files of data that the system has written about what an event that occured. The system is told what data it should care about and save.

-----

**Why do we use logs?**  
Logs are used for troubleshooting, audits, detcting misuse, and to help prove something happened (**non-repudiation**). Logs help to answer critical questions such as:
- What happened?
- When did it happen?
- Where did it happen?
- Who is responsible?
- Were their actions successful?
- What was the result of their action?

-----

**What is an event?**  
Something that happened. Such as:
- A user types entered the wrong password.
- A process started.
- A network connection opened.

-----

**What is a log entry?**  
A record of an event. Not all events become log entries. Only the events the system has been configured to record. Log entrys usually include a timestamp of when the event was logged, the name of the system or application that generated the log entry, the type of event that occurred, additional details about the event (the user who initiated the event or the device's IP address that generated the event).

-----

**What is an alert?**  
Alerts are when specific patterns of log entries occur. For example, 10 failed login attempts in 1 minute from the same IP address. These patterns are set by the administrators.  

Alerts can be imperfect which is why you get **false positives**.

-----

**What is a false positive?**  
False positives are when alerts are triggered, but there is no actual threat. This can happen because systems do not understand intent and rules can be blunt. It's important to expect false positives and be able to investigate what occurred.  

A false positive does not mean the alert is useless, it usually means context is missing.

-----

**Why are logs incomplete?**  
Logs are incomplete because systems are not configured to log everything by default because logging can affect performance and storage is limited. This means that if something isn't logged, it might still have happened.

-----

**What "normal activity" means**  
Normal means the system is working as expected at that time. Some alerts may seem conserning but are actually completely norrmal. For example:
- Failed login attempts
- Admin logins
- PowerShell running

Security analysis is about **unexpected combinations of activity** not individual events.

-----

**Most common log types:**
- Application logs: messages about specific applications.
- Audit logs: Activities related to operational procedures for regulatory compliance.
- Security logs: Security events such as logins, permissions changes, firewall activity.
- Server logs: Logs generated by servers.
- System logs: kernel activity, system errors, boot sequences, and hardware status.
- Network logs: Network traffic, connections, and other network related events.
- Database logs: Activities within a database system, such as queries and updates.
- Web server logs: Requests processed by a web server, including URLs, response codes.

-----

**Log formats**

A log format defines the structure and organisation of data within a log file. It specifies how the data is encoded, how each entry is delimited, and what fields are included in each row. These formats vary and may fall into three main categories:
- Semi structured: These logs contain structured and unstructured data with predictable components accommodating free form text. Some examples include:
  - Syslog message format: logging protocol for system and network logs.
