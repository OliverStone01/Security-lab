# Windows logs - level 1

I created this file to understand how Windows records logs and where the logs are stored.

### How Windows records logs

Windows logs are recorded in a `centralised` system called `Windows Event Log`. This system organises events generated by the operating system, system services, applications, and security components in a structured log.

Each **Event Log** includes:
- A timestamp
- An event source
- An event ID
- A severity level
- Event specific data

-----

### Event Viewer

Event Viewer is the main tool used in Windows to view logs. You can browse logs by category, filter events, view structured event details, and correlate events by time and source. 

-----

### Who controls what gets logged?

What events (including the level of detail and for how long logs are retained) is controlled by the administrators looking at security policies, group policies, application configurations and system audit settings.
